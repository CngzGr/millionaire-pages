    <h2>1) Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>appgur</strong> handles data in the <strong>Millionaire</strong> mobile app.
      The app does not offer accounts, sign-in, or user profiles, and we do not intentionally collect
      personally identifiable information directly from users.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Advertising (Google AdMob Only)</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> as the only advertising provider. AdMob may process certain
      device-related information (e.g., advertising ID, device information, approximate location) for
      ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention according to Google’s policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      appgur does not build user profiles and does not collect personal data such as name, email address,
      or phone number. Data processed for advertising is largely controlled by Google/AdMob.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ad provider: <strong>Google AdMob</strong></li>
      <li>Purpose: Ad delivery, ad performance measurement, fraud prevention</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifiers such as name, email address, or phone number</li>
      <li>Account / sign-in / profile information</li>
      <li>In-app messaging or social profile data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Analytics / Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      appgur does not use a separate analytics tool to create user profiles or track users based on personal data.
      Any measurement or tracking related to ads may occur only through AdMob components.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The app is not designed to collect personal data from children. If a parent or guardian believes that
      a child has provided personal data, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The app includes Google AdMob for advertising. Google’s data practices are governed by their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since appgur does not directly store personal data in the app, there is no dedicated personal data storage process.
      We still apply reasonable technical measures to keep the app secure.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page.
    </p>
